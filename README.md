 # React-Weather-API 🌡️🌦️

 <br>



#### This is my first project t was I used API with React.js. In this project, the user enters a city name and sees the country, air temperature and weather results of that city. Also this project is the first project I used tailwind. This project was completed using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience the basic Tailwind and React.js features. <br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- Flexbox
- Tailwind
- API
- React.js
